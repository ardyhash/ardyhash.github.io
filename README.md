# Personal Portfolio — ardyhashem.github.io

This repository contains a minimal, polished single-page portfolio intended for GitHub Pages. The site is populated with draft content (please review and update any personal details such as email, specific employers, and project links).

How to use
1. Files included in this repository root and assets/ directory are:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/css/style.css`
   - `assets/js/main.js`
   - `assets/images/headshot.svg` (placeholder)
   - `assets/images/favicon.svg` (placeholder)

2. Replace placeholders:
   - Update the About summary, Experience details, Projects, Skills and Contact email.
   - Replace `assets/images/headshot.svg` with your real headshot (recommended: 400×400 px SVG/PNG/JPG).
   - Replace the resume link (`#`) in the hero CTA with a URL or PDF path.

3. Commit and push to `main` (or default branch). Since this repo is named `ardyhashem.github.io`, GitHub Pages will serve directly from the root — no extra configuration needed.

Optional improvements
- Add analytics (e.g., Plausible or Google Analytics).
- Add a custom domain via GitHub repo Settings → Pages.
- Convert to a Jekyll/Theme if you want blog functionality or dynamic collections.
- Fetch public projects automatically from GitHub via the API (can be added later).
