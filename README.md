# Personal Portfolio — ardyhashem.github.io

This repository contains a minimal, polished single-page portfolio intended to be served by GitHub Pages.

How to use
1. Files included in this repository root and assets/ directory are:
   - `index.html`

2. Replace placeholders:
   - Update content replacing with your own.
   - Add an image if you so choose, currently there's one commented out.
   - Remove links or update to point to your own credentials/linkedin.
   - Remove Goat Counter analytics script just before </body>

3. Commit and push to `main` (or default branch). Since this repo is named `GITHUBUSERNAME.github.io`, GitHub Pages will serve directly from the root — no extra configuration needed.

Optional improvements
- Add analytics (e.g., Goat Counter, Plausible or Google Analytics).
- Add a custom domain via GitHub repo Settings → Pages.
- Convert to a Jekyll/Theme if you want blog functionality or dynamic collections.
- Fetch public projects automatically from GitHub via the API (can be added later).
